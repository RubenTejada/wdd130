        <p>Hi, my name is Ruben Tejada. I am from the Dominican Republic, and one of my passions is coding. Along with
            that, I am a
            proud father of two beautiful daughters, and I feel especially happy that one of them has also started
            learning how to
            code, which makes our journey even more exciting. Family is very important to me, and seeing my daughters
            grow and
            develop their talents fills me with gratitude. I am also deeply thankful for Pathway and the opportunity it
            provides to
            keep learning and improving myself. It is a blessing to be part of a program that helps me grow both
            personally and
            professionally. Family is very important to me, and seeing my daughters
